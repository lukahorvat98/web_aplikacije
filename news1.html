			<h2>Model X Earns a 5-Star Safety Rating from Euro NCAP</h2>
			<p class="description">
                Model X made history when it became the first and only SUV to ever receive a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
                
                </p>
			<p>Today, we’re excited to build on that legacy with the addition of a 5-star safety rating from the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), which evaluates a car’s safety assistance features as well as its ability to protect adults, children and vulnerable road users.</p>
			<p>Because Tesla knows its vehicles best, Tesla Insurance is able to leverage the advanced technology, safety, and serviceability of our cars to provide insurance at a lower cost.</p>
			<p>This pricing reflects the benefits of Tesla's active safety and advanced driver assistance features that come standard on all new Tesla vehicles.</p>
	        <p>Tesla owners in California can purchase a policy in as little as one minute via tesla.com/insurance.</p>   </p>
			<p>For new vehicle orders, customers can request a quote prior to delivery once a VIN has been assigned to their Tesla Account.</p>
			<p>Tesla Insurance offers a convenient monthly payment with no hidden fees or charges</p>
			<p>Customers may cancel or change their Tesla Insurance policy at any time.</p>
