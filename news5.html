                The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther
                
                </h2>
			<p class="description"> 
               
                For more than a decade, Tesla engineers have been obsessed with making the world’s most efficient electric vehicles. </p>
            <p>As a result, Tesla vehicles already travel farther on a single charge than any other production EV on the market.</p>

            <p>Today, we’re making changes to Model S and Model X that allow them to travel unprecedented distances without needing to recharge, beating our own record for the longest-range production EVs on the road.</p>
            <p>And we’ve accomplished this without increasing the cars’ battery size, proving that our expertise in system-level design can make our cars dramatically more efficient.</p>
            <p>Beginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle’s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging.</p>
            <p>We’re also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.</p>
